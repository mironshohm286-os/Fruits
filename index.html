                    <h1>Fruits.</h1>
                    <p>In botany, a fruit is the seed-bearing structure in flowering <br>
                     plants (angiosperms) that is formed from the ovary after flowering.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Fruits are the means by which angiosperms disseminate their seeds. Edible <br>
                        fruits in particular have long propagated using the movements of humans <br>
                        and other animals in a symbiotic relationship that is the means for seed <br>
                        dispersal for the one group and nutrition for the other; humans, and many other <br>
                        animals, have become dependent on fruits as a source of food.[1] Consequently, <br>
                        fruits account for a substantial fraction of the world's agricultural output, <br>
                        and some (such as the apple and the pomegranate) have acquired extensive cultural <br>
                        and symbolic meanings.

                        is an evergreen tree in the laurel family (Lauraceae). It is <br> 
                        native to the Americas, with archaeological evidence of early <br> 
                        human avocado use dating back thousands of years across various <br> 
                        regions of Central and South America. It was prized for its large <br>

                        family Rutaceae. Botanically, this is the hybrid Citrus × sinensis, <br> 
                        between the pomelo (Citrus maxima) and the mandarin orange (Citrus reticulata). <br> 
                        The chloroplast genome, and therefore the maternal line, is that <br>

                        Fruit trees of the orchard or domestic apple (Malus domestica), the <br> 
                        most widely grown in the genus, are cultivated worldwide. The tree <br> 
                        originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, <br> 
                        is still found. Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Eurasia <br>

                        by several kinds of large treelike herbaceous flowering plants in the <br> 
                        genus Musa. In some countries, cooking bananas are called plantains, <br> 
                        distinguishing them from dessert bananas. The fruit is variable in size, <br> 
                        color and firmness, but is usually elongated and curved, with soft flesh <br> 
                        rich in starch covered with a peel, which may have a variety of colors...

                        a widely grown hybrid plant cultivated worldwide for its fruit. The genus <br> 
                        Fragaria, the strawberries, is in the rose family, Rosaceae. The fruit is <br> 
                        appreciated for its aroma, bright red colour, juicy texture, and sweetness. <br> 
                        It is eaten either fresh or in prepared foods such as jam, ice cream, and <br> 
                        chocolates. Artificial strawberry flavourings and aromas are widely used...
